# 🧠 Data Analysis Project: [Project Title Here]

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing [dataset topic, e.g. shopping behavior / customer churn / sales trends] to extract meaningful insights and visualize patterns using Python.

We walk through the complete data analysis pipeline:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries
- Visualizations
- (Optional) Machine Learning or Predictive Modeling

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Dataset Name or Link, e.g. Kaggle / UCI / Internal]
- **Shape**: [Rows] rows × [Columns] columns
- **Features**: 
  - `Feature_1`: short description  
  - `Feature_2`: short description  
  - ...

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization  
- `numpy` for numerical operations  
- (Optional) `scikit-learn` for modeling
